# r-vscode-tools README

This extension extends support for R in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). It adds the following commands in the Quick Open menu:
- R: Check package
- R: Install package directory
- R: Install selected R package - this will install a package selected in the currently active document; if no text is selected an input box appears


## TODO
1. ~~Add script to install the current package directory~~
2. ~~Functionality to install R packages~~
3. Add basic support for rmarkdown
